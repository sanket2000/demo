You can now reboot your computer.
Please do not forget to make your BIOS boot on sda (ATA ST3500413AS) disk!

The boot files of [The OS now in use - Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS] are far from the start of the disk. Your BIOS may not detect them. You may want to retry after creating a /boot partition (EXT4, >200MB, start of the disk). This can be performed via tools such as gParted. Then select this partition via the [Separate /boot partition:] option of [Boot Repair]. (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition)
